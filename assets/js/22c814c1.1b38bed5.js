Countless IoT devices and sensors interact with each other every day.

Without providing for an architecture that enables the creation of trust, anyone could fake traffic data and cause havoc in an automated traffic system relying on external data.

We have two formats in order to optimize DID resolution times and they need to be created and used in a specific way. With the account, a single line of code takes care of all the message formatting and publishing to the Tangle. Similarly, creating an identity is a rather complicated process as you first need to generate a keypair, from which you derive a DID. Afterwards, a DID Document is created, in which the public key must be embedded and this must be published to the Tangle. Lastly, the private key needs to be stored and managed in a secure manner. The account does all this in a single line of code, storing the private key inside a Stronghold, or a different storage method defined by the developer."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Currently the account feature is only available in Rust and not yet available as Javascript bindings as this requires some bigger design improvements in the project that we want to tackle during our road towards a 1.0 version."),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"did-communications"},"DID Communications"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The other major feature that we have implemented is the DID Communications messages. These are standardized messages that two IOTA Identity actors would send to each other to do anything related to identity. For example, they can ask each other to prove control over their identities, but also request verifiable credentials to be shared or even signed. Using these messages doesn\u2019t just make it easier to create IOTA Identity powered applications, but also creates immediate interoperability between applications. As such, an IOTA Identity app made by one company could interact with an app made by another."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"So far, we have defined our version of the exact message layout and created a basic example actor on how to automatically generate and respond to DID Communications messages in Rust.

In fact, we are very happy to soon start working together with the LINKS Foundation, who are creating a Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) specification for IOTA Identity, massively increasing the privacy features of IOTA Identity.
